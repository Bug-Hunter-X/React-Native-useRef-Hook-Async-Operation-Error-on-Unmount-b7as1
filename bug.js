This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a component that's unmounted before the asynchronous operation inside `useRef` completes.  The asynchronous operation might be a `setTimeout`, `fetch` call, or any other operation that doesn't finish immediately.

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const timerRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    timerRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('Timer fired!');
    }, 3000);
    return () => clearTimeout(timerRef.current); // Cleanup function
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      {/* Component content */}
    </View>
  );
}
```

If `MyComponent` is unmounted before the 3-second timeout expires, you might still see the 'Timer fired!' log, even though the component is no longer on the screen. This is because the timer continues running independently of the component's lifecycle.
